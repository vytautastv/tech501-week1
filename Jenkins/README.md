### 1. Provider Setup

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"  # Specify the region you want to launch the EC2 in
}
Explanation: This block configures the AWS provider, specifying the region where the EC2 instance will be launched. eu-west-1 refers to the Ireland region.
Important: Choose the region closest to you for better latency.

2. Security Group
Terraform

resource "aws_security_group" "tech501_vy_jenkins_sg" {
  name        = "tech501-vy-jenkins-sg"
  description = "Allow inbound traffic for Jenkins server"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # SSH access
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 3000
    to_port     = 3000
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Jenkins HTTP access on port 3000
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] # Allow all outbound traffic
  }
}
Explanation: This block defines a security group named tech501-vy-jenkins-sg. Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your EC2 instances.

ingress blocks: Define inbound rules.

Port 22: Allows SSH access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).

Security Best Practice: Restrict this to your IP address or a known CIDR block for better security.

Port 3000: Allows HTTP access to Jenkins from anywhere.

Security Best Practice: Restrict access after initial setup.

egress block: Defines outbound rules. This allows all outbound traffic, which is generally the default.

3. EC2 Instance

resource "aws_instance" "jenkins_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0417261d92cf9faf0"  # Ubuntu 22.04 LTS AMI (update this to the latest version)
  instance_type = "t3.micro"  # Instance size (update according to your needs)
  key_name      = "tech501-vytautas-aws-key" # Specify your EC2 key pair name
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.tech501_vy_jenkins_sg.name]
  # ... (provisioner block - explained below)
  tags = {
    Name = "Jenkins-EC2"
  }
}

Explanation: This block creates the EC2 instance.
ami: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI). ami-0417261d92cf9faf0 is an example (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
Important: Always use the latest, recommended AMI for your chosen operating system. You can find the latest AMIs in the AWS console or using the AWS CLI.
instance_type: Defines the instance size. t3.micro is a small, cost-effective instance.
Choose an instance type appropriate for your Jenkins workload.
key_name: Specifies the EC2 key pair for SSH access. You must have this key pair created in your AWS account.
security_groups: Attaches the security group created earlier to the instance.
tags: Adds tags for easier identification and management.

1. Provisioner (Inside aws_instance)
Terraform

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update -y",
      "sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y",
      "sudo apt-get install wget -y",
      "wget -q -O - [https://pkg.jenkins.io/keys/jenkins.io.key](https://pkg.jenkins.io/keys/jenkins.io.key) | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/jenkins.asc",
      "echo deb [http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/](http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/) stable main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list",
      "sudo apt-get update -y",
      "sudo apt-get install jenkins -y",
      "sudo systemctl enable jenkins",
      "sudo systemctl start jenkins",
      "sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp",
      "sudo ufw reload"
    ]
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/Users/vytautastvarijonas/.ssh/tech501-vytautas-aws-key.pem")
      host        = self.public_ip
    }

  }
Explanation: This block uses a remote-exec provisioner to run commands on the EC2 instance after it's created.

Contains the commands to execute.

sudo apt-get update -y: Updates the package list.
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk -y: Installs Java (required for Jenkins).
sudo apt-get install wget -y: Installs wget (for downloading the Jenkins key).
wget ... | sudo tee ...: Downloads and adds the Jenkins repository key.
echo ... | sudo tee ...: Adds the Jenkins repository to the apt sources.
sudo apt-get update -y: Updates the package list again.
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y: Installs Jenkins.
sudo systemctl enable jenkins: Enables Jenkins to start on boot.
sudo systemctl start jenkins: Starts the Jenkins service.
sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp: Opens port 3000 in the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw).
sudo ufw reload: Reloads the firewall rules.
connection: Defines how to connect to the instance.
type = "ssh": Uses SSH.
user = "ubuntu": The username on the EC2 instance.
private_key: The path to your private key file.
Important: Ensure this path is correct.
host = self.public_ip: The public IP address of the EC2 instance.

1. Output
Terraform

output "jenkins_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.jenkins_instance.public_ip
}
Explanation: This block outputs the public IP address of the Jenkins instance after it's created, making it easy to access.
Key Improvements and Considerations
Security: Restrict SSH access to your IP address or a known CIDR block. After initial Jenkins setup, consider restricting access to port 3000 as well. Implement proper authentication and authorization within Jenkins itself.
AMI: Always use the latest, recommended AMI.
Instance Type: Choose an appropriate instance type based on your needs. t3.micro is suitable for testing, but you might need a larger instance for production.
Key Pair: Ensure you have the correct key pair and that the path to the private key is accurate.
Provisioner: While remote-exec works, consider using a more robust configuration management tool like Ansible or Chef for complex setups. This will make your infrastructure more manageable and repeatable.
User Data: For simple installations, you can also use user data instead of provisioners. This is a cloud-init script that runs when the instance starts.
